# NHL Playoff Elimination Tracker

This interactive web app visualizes the progression of NHL playoff eliminations for any season from 1967 through 2025. It features a geographic display of all NHL teams, with logos positioned based on team location and animated in elimination order based on historical results â€” including both regular season and postseason outcomes.

Designed for fans, analysts, and historians, this project offers a unique way to explore how the Stanley Cup Playoffs unfolded across decades of NHL history.

## Data Sources

- **Team Coordinates**  
  Manually curated geographic data for NHL franchises, accounting for relocations, name changes, and expansion history.

- **Elimination Sequences**  
  A single JSON file (`NHLelimseq.json`) provides the elimination order for every NHL team in each season from 1967 to 2025. These sequences reflect both regular season eliminations (i.e., teams that failed to qualify) and playoff losses.  
  All sequences were **manually verified** by reviewing daily standings across many seasons â€” especially during the final weeks of the regular season â€” to ensure historical accuracy.

- **Logos**  
  Each seasonâ€™s folder contains the official team logos used in that year, providing an authentic visual context. Logos are chosen to reflect the look and feel of each era.
